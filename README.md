## Introduction
Aim is to experiment in creation of web illustrations purely using SVG Paths, Clipping Paths and Linear Gradients in the form of a tribute page.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* SVG Path Builder (by Anthony Dugios)
* Get Waves
* Blobmaker
* CSS Grid

## Launch
* Released on Github Pages on 18 December 2020
https://naomijustin.github.io/nigirizushi/

## Illustrations
* I created all illustrations using the SVG Path Builder, and then stacked filled paths within clipped paths. I filled all the non-greyscale sections using linear gradients to create the illusion of highlights and shadows on a flat shape.

## Scope of functionalities 
* Responsive, lightweight illustrations.

## Project status 
* Completed
